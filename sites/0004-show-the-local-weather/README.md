# **Local_Weather_Viewer**
### **"Show the Local Weather"** is a requirement for freeCodeCamp Front End Certification: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather
#### **Date Completed**: Mar 06, 2016

>1. **Objective**: Build a [CodePen.io]('https://codepen.io') app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

>2. Fulfill the below [user stories]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story'). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

>3. **User Story**: I can see the weather in my current location.

>4. **User Story**: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

>5. **User Story**: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

>6. We recommend using the [Open Weather API]('https://openweathermap.org/current#geo'). This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

>7. Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask]('https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/FreeCodeCamp-Get-Help') if you get stuck.

>8. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

>9. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
